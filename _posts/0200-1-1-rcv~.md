### One to many 3D vector receive

**[rcv~]** is a wrapper for pd's built in **[receive~]**. Internally, it creates three unique receives based on the symbol argument provided on creation. For example, foo-x foo-y foo-z. While not completely necessary, to avoid warnings the matching **[snd~]** should be made to first.

A **[send~]** object copies its input to a local buffer which all **[receive~]** objects of the same name read from. They may be in different windows or even different patches. Any number of receives may be associated with one **[send~]** but it is an error to have two sends of the same name.
