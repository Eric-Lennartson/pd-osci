### Output to Scope and Speakers

**[out~]** is used to send audio to both speakers and oscilloscope. It takes 3 inputs, (x, y, and bright). It has 5 outlets, (x, y, bright, speaker left, and speaker right). It also has internal **[catch~]** objects named m-out-x, m-out-y, and m-out-bright which can be useful for removing patch cables and keeping your patches clean. The scope level is linear, while the speaker level is in db.
