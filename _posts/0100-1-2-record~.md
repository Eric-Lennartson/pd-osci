### Recording utility + [writesf~] settings manager

**[record~]** provides a useful interface for managing the settings of **[writesf~]** and recording. When the red toggle is clicked, a notification is posted to the console, and the recording starts. There's a bug I haven't figured out how to correct yet, but before recording make sure to select your settings, as **[writesf~]** will throw an error even though I've set it up to have defaults.
