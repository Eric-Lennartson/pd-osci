==== Roadmap ===================================================================
- finish general improvements then start working on remapping tree.
- figure out how to add in remapping tree... 
==== Bugs ======================================================================
- something wrong for octa and octahedron in makefile
- chris_clip~-g crash when mod was on, moving the min option
    - fix in pd patch? or the source?
==== Things to Improve =========================================================
- add osci/ creators to binops
- All objects need to have option for args and defaults if not provided.
    - These should be listed in the documentation as well.
- add in a spot killer abstraction
- rethink gui version of chris_clip~, is there a better way
- add an auto make-up gain to chris_clip~-g?
- update the readme to include the new objs
- double check that new objs are documented
COMPLETE THE ABOVE AND PUT OUT A NEW VERSION
=================================================================================
- vectorize perf functions if possible
- create lookup tables for cos and sin
- fix links to helpfiles in aliases
- using bool seems to cause problems
- would having flags for args be helpful for some objects?
    - it seems silly to have to specify all args if you only want
      to put in some of them. (thinking about rotate_pivot~)

==== Gui Stuff =================================================================
- could I do something where the gui is a completely separate abstraction that 
can control how other objects work? (something like acriel)

==== Documentation =============================================================
- what are the defaults for cuboid? (and it's relatives)
==== Misc ======================================================================
