==== Roadmap ===================================================================
- finish general improvements then start working on remapping tree.
- figure out how to add in remapping tree...
- could I add in a link to blender via OSC?
==== Bugs ======================================================================
- something wrong for octa and octahedron in makefile
- chris_clip~-g crash when mod was on, moving the min option
    - fix in pd patch? or the source?
==== Things to Improve =========================================================
- update the online documentation, and this version is done!
COMPLETE THE ABOVE AND PUT OUT A NEW VERSION
=================================================================================
- create a dev branch to mess around in, you know, so it's organized
- mess around with the scan processing from derek's library and get it working
- is there a convienient way to get rid of unused parameter warnings?
- idea for objs like cuboid, setting certain related args with msgs like -size?
- vectorize perf functions if possible
- create lookup tables for cos and sin
    - take a look at how it's done in the pd source
- fix links to helpfiles in aliases
- using bool seems to cause problems
- would having flags for args be helpful for some objects?
    - it seems silly to have to specify all args if you only want
      to put in some of them. (thinking about rotate_pivot~)

==== Gui Stuff =================================================================
- could I do something where the gui is a completely separate abstraction that 
can control how other objects work? (something like acriel)

==== Documentation =============================================================
- what are the defaults for cuboid? (and it's relatives)
==== Misc ======================================================================
