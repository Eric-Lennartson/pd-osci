==== Roadmap ===================================================================
- finish general improvements then start working on remapping tree.
- figure out how to add in remapping tree... 
==== Bugs ======================================================================
- something wrong for octa and octahedron in makefile
- chris_clip~-g crash when mod was on, moving the min option
    - fix in pd patch? or the source?
==== Things to Improve =========================================================
- add axis, and degree/radian messages to rotate~
- could I add more types of rotation objects?
    - If I'm making more rotation objects how should they be named?
    - would it be better to have a message that sets the mode of one rotation object?
- All objects need to have option for args and defaults if not provided.
    - These should be listed in the documentation as well.
- add in a spot killer abstraction
- rethink gui version of chris_clip~, is there a better way
- create a shear abstraction that manipulates all the axes at once
    - can I set it up to specify order? (is it useful?)
    - add degree and radian messages
- create an abstraction for dash~ that allows for dashing 3D objects
    - each vector can have separate dashes OR be linked together.
- add an auto make-up gain to chris_clip~-g?

==== Gui Stuff =================================================================
- could I do something where the gui is a completely separate abstraction that 
can control how other objects work? (something like acriel)

==== Documentation =============================================================
- what are the defaults for cuboid? (and it's relatives)
==== Misc ======================================================================
