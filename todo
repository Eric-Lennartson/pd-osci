==== Roadmap ===================================================================
- Adjust the built in pd help files, have them also link to the gh-pages
==== Bugs ======================================================================

==== Things to Improve =========================================================
- All objects need to have option for args and defaults if not provided.
    - These should be listed in the documentation as well.
- Can I have writesf~ write to a specific directory? 
- redo the gui for record~
- add in a spot killer abstraction
- rethink gui version of chris_clip~, is there a better way
- add axis, and degree/radian messages to rotate~
- could I add more types of rotation objects?
- create a shear abstraction that manipulates all the axes at once
    - can I set it up to specify order? (is it useful?)
    - add degree and radian messages
- create an abstraction for dash~ that allows for dashing 3D objects
    - each vector can have separate dashes OR be linked together.
    - when dash length is 1, it shouldn't wrap around

==== Documentation =============================================================
- what are the defaults for cuboid? (and it's relatives)
==== Misc ======================================================================
- in all_objects, make square~ osci/square~
