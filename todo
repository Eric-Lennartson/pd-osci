==== Roadmap ===================================================================
- Decide, what is happening with xy_splitter?
- Decide, should record~ have signal inlets? or should it just handle the writesf 
    messages?
- figure out how to add in remapping tree... 
==== Bugs ======================================================================
==== Things to Improve =========================================================
- All objects need to have option for args and defaults if not provided.
    - These should be listed in the documentation as well.
- Can I have writesf~ write to a specific directory? 
- add in a spot killer abstraction
- rethink gui version of chris_clip~, is there a better way
- add axis, and degree/radian messages to rotate~
- could I add more types of rotation objects?
- create a shear abstraction that manipulates all the axes at once
    - can I set it up to specify order? (is it useful?)
    - add degree and radian messages
- create an abstraction for dash~ that allows for dashing 3D objects
    - each vector can have separate dashes OR be linked together.
    - when dash length is 1, it shouldn't wrap around
- add an auto make-up gain to chris_clip~-g?

==== Gui Stuff =================================================================
- could I do something where the gui is a completely separate abstraction that 
can control how other objects work? (something like acriel)

==== Documentation =============================================================
- what are the defaults for cuboid? (and it's relatives)
- make sure that all the abstractions are documented
==== Misc ======================================================================
