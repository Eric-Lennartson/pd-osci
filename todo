==== Roadmap ===================================================================
- trace~
    - fix this, not sure why it is so bad now

- add some distortion effects
    - swirl
    - randomize?
    - work on this when I get tired of figuring out how to implement tsp

- osci/tsp~
    - this requires making an osc abstraction (copy this in from previous patch I made)
    - crashes on the same objects as the js code does. My algorithm is expensive when there's lots of even to odd conversions

- calibrate~
    - dark and light mode
    - finalize distortion grid fixes
        - might need to completely rethink how the grid distorts

- add a rotation using quaternions. that way there is no gimbal lock issues.

- osci/m_transform~
    - test out the abstraction
    - add a helpfile
    - add to the online docs

- osci/out~
    - update the online docs

- tabreadlin~
    - add to the online docs

- turn all the brightness abstractions into objects when finished with them

- finish general improvements then start working on remapping tree.
- figure out how to add in remapping tree...

- update the helpfiles with the bypass option
- make sure helpfiles have the defaults of the objects in there!
==== Bugs ======================================================================
all
- figure out the strange radians / degree bug on shear and others.
- trace~ help file needs to have better defaults
mac
linux
    - icosahedron and octahedron look odd, why?
windows
    - not trying to compile this unless someone seriously is asking for it.
==== Things to Improve =========================================================
- create a dev branch to mess around in, you know, so it's organized
- mess around with the scan processing from derek's library and get it working
    - what features are in derek's library that would be useful to have in mine?
- is there a convienient way to get rid of unused parameter warnings?
- idea for objs like cuboid, setting certain related args with msgs like -size?
- vectorize perf functions if possible
- create lookup tables for cos and sin
    - take a look at how it's done in the pd source
- using bool seems to cause problems
- would having flags for args be helpful for some objects?
    - it seems silly to have to specify all args if you only want
      to put in some of them. (thinking about rotate_pivot~)

==== Gui Stuff =================================================================
- could I do something where the gui is a completely separate abstraction that
can control how other objects work? (something like acriel)

==== Documentation =============================================================
- what are the defaults for cuboid? (and it's relatives)
==== Misc ======================================================================
